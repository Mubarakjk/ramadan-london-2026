🌙 Ramadan London 2026
Ramadan is one of the most special months for Muslims around the world. It’s a time of reflection, gratitude, and spiritual growth.
As a Muslim myself, I know how important it is to stay connected with prayer times, remember Allah, and keep up with daily duas during this blessed month. I wanted to create something simple, practical, and meaningful — a website for anyone observing Ramadan in London.

✨ About This Project
Ramadan London 2026 is built to be your companion this Ramadan. It includes:
🕌 Accurate, real-time prayer times for London
 Daily updated Gregorian & Hijri dates
 Live countdowns for Suhoor and Iftar
 A collection of Duas and Hadith for daily reflection
🤲 Reminders for Dhikr, like:
SubhanAllah (33x)
Alhamdulillah (33x)
Allahu Akbar (33x)
The goal is to make this website easy to use, reliable, and meaningful — whether you check it once a day or keep it open during Ramadan.
 Why I Built This
I realised that during Ramadan, I was constantly switching between different apps and websites to check prayer times, Hijri dates, and daily duas. I wanted to make something simple, clean, and tailored for Muslims in London.
This project is my small contribution — a digital space where anyone can stay connected, keep track of prayer times, and reflect throughout the month.
If it helps even one person stay consistent or feel more connected during Ramadan, that’s more than enough.

🤍 Final Note
Ramadan is a time for reflection, compassion, and community. I hope this website can make your daily routines a little easier and more meaningful.
May Allah accept our fasts, prayers, and good deeds. Ramadan Mubarak 🌙
